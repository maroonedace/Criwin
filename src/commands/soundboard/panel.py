"""Soundboard button panel.

A message of buttons (one per sound) posted in a channel, one panel per guild showing
only that guild's sounds. Buttons are persistent ``DynamicItem``s (their handler is
registered once at startup and survives restarts), so a panel keeps working across
reboots and as sounds change. An hourly task rebuilds every panel's message(s) from
its guild's soundboard.
